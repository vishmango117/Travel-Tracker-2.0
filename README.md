> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The assignment roughly took about 25 Hours with 
- 2 Hours set to building the classes
- 6 Hours with testing and connecting the GUI to the main program 
- 4 hours in building functions controlling the data structures and list
- 3 hours in testing and checking the error validation
- 4 hours on overall program testing and debugging the program
- 2-3 hours on documentation and code refactoring.


## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Compared to the previous Travel Tracker (1.0) classes help encase every place in a object rather than in list of dictionaries which helps in
easier understanding on how to access or reference the data. Also going into GUI programs despite being diffcult to use is still exciting to learn and implement.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Kivy and their insufferable documentation which results in outdated help which results in struggling to find resources to help the debugging process related to errors and warning with kivy. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
With the help of classes I was able to segment the code by first testing the program main functions like load_places, add_places and save_places
and test on that without needing to great and run the interaction with the window of Kivy with this i was able to employ divide and conquer strategies that help me parallely build the gui app, connection on one hand and functionality in another app.


## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
My Process with this project can be improved by structuring the requirements in a flow chart to help understand what are the main function requirements and hence can streamline the process of developing the program. Process can also be improved by using more updated GUI toolkits like tkinter which have a more robust and up to date documentations and provides much ease of use.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Lecture Slides and demos from the practicals and a combination of Python Documentation and Kivy Documentation. I also refered from 
Lecture Notes specifically from Chapter 15 - Testing, Practical 06 - Classes Lecture Notes for Chapter 11 - Classes, KivyDemos..
The main websites i refer from are the following
- https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/tree/master/prac_06 
- https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos
- https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns
## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges I noticed are working with mainly Kivy as debugging Kivy took a while to do. Other obstacles are complying with PEP8 guidelines as it makes it tricky to break down the lines to keep the 79 character lines.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes at first took a while to understand but after a thorough examination through the examples it became easier to understand the objects. With the help of classes we can access its instance and methods easily without needing to send data as parameters to functions and return them back to make sure the values are constantly updated
